To test the application run these to examples and compare the ouput files:

1) This example will run gamma-ray source 88Y
in DANCE, 5000 events. Run: 

$G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/DANCE MasterInput_Ex1.txt # DICEBOX_DANCE or DANCE?
and compare your RootOut_Ex1.root to ./Examples/RootOut_Ex1.root.



2) This example will run artificial cascades from the file
InputFile_Ex2.dat. Here each event has multiplicity M=3
and Eg1=1MeV, Eg2=2MeV and Eg3=3MeV.
See MasterInput_Ex2.txt for how to set the flags to read from external
file.

Run:
$G4WORKDIR/bin/$G4SYSTEM/DANCE MasterInput_Ex1.txt
Compare RooutOut_Ex2 with ./Examples/RootOut_Ex2.root.

See also SG4900keV.mac for how to run single gamma rays.
